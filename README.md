#Term One **hackathon**


We are going to take a look at customers,how they spend their money,what their actual day looks like in a form of a **documentary**.We also want to check what their spending is on a **day-to-day** to a **week-to-week**, **month-to-month** even **year-to-year** basis.

We want to get the look and feel of our customers, we want to get to know our customers more.  We want our customers to involve us in their world so we can also understand it better.

Then take a **graph** and check the differences and similarities between the two **personas**(The one who is aware of their spending habits and the one who is not aware of their spending habits).
